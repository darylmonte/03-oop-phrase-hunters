# Phrase Hunters Using Python and OOP
I created a guessing game: "Guess That Movie Quote" using Python and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).

## Flow of the game
1. A random phrase will be chosen at the start of the game.
2. Each time a player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, it displays the chosen letters on the screen.
3. A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).
4. The player will have an option to play again or exit the game.
